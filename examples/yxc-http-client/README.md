# YXC Sample Calls

This directory contains sample calls for the Yamaha Extended Control API.
There's a somewhat recent API doc floating around the net (Yamaha_Extended_Control_API_Specification_(Basic).pdf Rev 1.10).
They've been tested against my personal devices (WX-021, WX-051, CD-NT670D).

The files should be self-documenting.
To run the *.http files see the [Idea HTTP Client](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html) or the [httpyac](https://httpyac.github.io) CLI/VS Code plugin.
The configured environments should load in both tools but are just for demonstration purposes, as they only work in my personal network.
